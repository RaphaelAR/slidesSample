# Introduction

## Abstract

- Applying novel machine learning techniques to big data in social psychology by a) establishing a more predictable variable of attitudes toward Black people, and b) creating a single model which integrates five previously established stereotype and prejudicial measures
- Random Forest Regressor (python, sklearn); Explainable Boosting Machine (python, Microsoft)
- Social distance, victim blaming, egalitarianism, intergroup anxiety, blatant negative stereotypes

## Machine Learning in Social Sciences
- Goal of psychological science as the quest to understand human behavior — to explain the cognitive causations and predict future behaviors
- Too much focus placed on causations
- Machine learning and big data should be used to focus on predictions

## Prejudice and Stereotype Measures

- Social distance scale is one earliest of these measures and was designed to quantify the desired separation from a stigmatized group
- Intergroup anxiety is directly correlated with intergroup relations
- Egalitarianism promotes communalism and equality
- Protestant work ethic values individualism and self-reliance
- knowledge of existing negative stereotypes as well as personal acceptance of those stereotypes leads to blatant prejudices against the perceived inferior out-group

# Methods

## IAT

- projectimplicit.org
- Race (White over Black preference), 2018
- 117,000 entries; 400 variables

## CIEBA
Concurrent Implicit-Explicit Black preference Attitude
*CIEBA = (implicit1_z + explicit1_z + explicit4_z)/3
implicit1 = IAT raw score
explicit1_z = explicit1 (normalized)
explicit2_z = explicit2 (normalized)
explicit3_z = explicit3 (normalized)
explicit4_z = explicit2_z – explicit 3_z*

# Results
